Use the scripts to create the DBAUtility database on each SQL server instance.
Schedule a job to collect various statistics related to the instance to get a daily snapshot.

NOTE: One of the most useful feature that I have found that I reach out to frequently is the permissions snapshot.
We can use to clone permissions of an existing user in a SQL instance to mirror the permissions for a new hire.
We can also restore a lost user permission from a latest snapshot of permissions.
You could also look at the trends of index usage, server cache, server CPU etc.
